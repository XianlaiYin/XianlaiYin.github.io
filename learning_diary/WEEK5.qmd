### **1.1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)**

## **2 Summary: practical**

> This week's practical will consist mainly of the following:
>
> -   Introduction and access to Landsat data
> -   A deeper understanding of atmospheric correction and how it works in practice
> -   Introduction to the principles of Radiance (or DN) to Reflectance
> -   Practical exercises in image joining
> -   A deep understanding of image enhancement and how it works in practice

For this week's practical I chose to follow the guidance using Landsat data from Cape Town. I used R to do atmospheric corrections, merging, data enhancement and other operations on the data. Through practical, I gained a better understanding of remote sensing data pre-processing and was able to apply this to my workflow in R. Combined with the previous term's CASA0005 course, I can now use R to analyse more types of data.

## **3 Application**

> This week, the main focus was on the correction, joining and enhancement of remote sensing images, mostly applied to pre-processing before analysis, but remote sensing image enhancement has a wider range of applications.

### **3.1 Applications of remote sensing image enhancement**
