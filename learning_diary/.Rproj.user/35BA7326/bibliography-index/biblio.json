            "abstract": "Urban trees exhibit a wide range of ecosystem services that have long been unveiled and increasingly reported. The ability to map tree species and analyze tree health conditions would become vividly essential. Remote sensing techniques, especially hyperspectral imaging, are being evolved for species identification and vegetation monitoring from spectral reponse patterns. In this study, a hyperspectral library for urban tree species in Hong Kong was established comprising 75 urban trees belonging to 19 species. 450 bi-monthly images were acquired by a terrestrial hyperspectral camera (SPECIM-IQ) from November 2018 to October 2019. A Deep Neural Network classification model was developed to identify tree species from the hyperspectral imagery with an overall accuracy ranging from 85% to 96% among different seasons. Representative spectral reflectance curves of healthy and unhealthy conditions for each species were extracted and analyzed. The hyperspectral phenology models were developed to achieve high accuracy and optimization of data acquisition. The bi-monthly canopy signatures and vegetation indices revealed different seasonality patterns of evergreen and deciduous species in Hong Kong. We explored the utility of terrestrial hyperspectral remote sensing and Deep Neural Network for urban tree species identification and characterizing. This provides a unique baseline to understand hyperspectral characteristics and seasonality of urban tree species in Hong Kong that can also contribute to hyperspectral imaging and database development elsewhere in the world.",

            "abstract": "Remote‐sensing change detection based on multitemporal, multispectral, and multisensor imagery has been developed over several decades and provided timely and comprehensive information for planning and decision‐making. In practice, however, it is still difficult to select a suitable change‐detection method, especially in urban areas, because of the impacts of complex factors. This paper presents a new method using multitemporal and multisensor data (SPOT‐5 and Landsat data) to detect land‐use changes in an urban environment based on principal‐component analysis (PCA) and hybrid classification methods. After geometric correction and radiometric normalization, PCA was used to enhance the change information from stacked multisensor data. Then, a hybrid classifier combining unsupervised and supervised classification was performed to identify and quantify land‐use changes. Finally, stratified random and user‐defined plots sampling methods were synthetically used to obtain total 966 reference points for accuracy assessment. Although errors and confusion exist, this method shows satisfying results with an overall accuracy to be 89.54% and 0.88 for the kappa coefficient. When compared with the post‐classification method, PCA‐based change detection also showed a better accuracy in terms of overall, producer’s, and user’s accuracy and kappa index. The results suggested that significant land‐use changes have occurred in Hangzhou City from 2000 to 2003, which may be related to rapid economy development and urban expansion. It is further indicated that most changes occurred in cropland areas due to urban encroachment.",

            "abstract": "Quantification of global forest change has been lacking despite the recognized importance of forest ecosystem services. In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil’s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.",
