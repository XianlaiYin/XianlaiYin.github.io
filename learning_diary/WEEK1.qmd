------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **1.1 Remote sensing**

#### **Definition** {.unnumbered}

NASA defines remote sensing as `acquiring information from a distance`, interchangeable used with Earth Observation or EO.

#### **Data acquisition** {.unnumbered}

This is achieved through sensors mounted on a platform, e.g. satellites, planes (aerial imagery), drones, phones, free standing on the ground or sea (with hand held devices), there are more than 150 satellites in orbit carrying sensors.

#### **Advantages** {.unnumbered}

-   Mass of data: satellites collect data on the same points on Earth every day to every 16 days
-   Frequency of update and less reliance on authorities (e.g. London Atlas)
-   More free resources to process large volumes of data (e.g. Google Earth Engine)

#### **Types of sensor** {.unnumbered}

***Passive sensor***

-   Use energy that is available
-   Don't emit anything
-   Usually detecting reflected energy from the sun
-   Energy is in electromagnetic waves...
-   Such as: Human eye, camera, satellite sensor

***Active sensor***

-   Have an energy source for illumination
-   Actively emits electormagentic waves and then waits to receive
-   Such as: Radar, X-ray, LiDAR

### **1.2 Electromagentic waves**

::: callout-tip
#### Terms {.unnumbered}

-   Waves of an electromagnetic field, travel through space and carry radiant energy = `Electromagnetic radiation (EMR)`. Waves are part of the EMR spectrum.
-   Energy carried by EMR waves = `radiant energy`
-   Energy per unit of time = `radiant flux`
-   Energy from the sun = `incoming short wave radiation` or `shortwave radiation`
-   Energy (solar power) from the sun per unit area per unit time (from electromagnetic radiation) = `solar irradiance` (per unit time - flux)
-   Energy leaving a surface per unit area per unit time = `Exitance (emittance)` (per unit time - flux)
-   *Flux means time here.*

#### **Electromagnetic radiation (EMR)** {.unnumbered}

EMR has both electric and magnetic fields, propagates (moves) as waves: `c = vλ`

-   `c` = velocity of light 3 x 10\^8 meters per second
-   `v` = frequency, rate of oscillation
-   `λ` = wavelength, distance between two crests

EMR isn't automatically reflected. It experiences a number of changes prior to hitting the sensor

-   `Surface`: Energy being absorbed by the surface and being transmitted through the surface
-   `Atmospheric`: Energy can be scattered by particles in the atmosphere

### **1.3 Interacting with Earth's surface**

#### **Atmospheric scattering** {.unnumbered}

-   `Rayleigh` = particles are very small compared to the wavelength
-   `Mie` = particles are the same size compared to the wavelength
-   `Non selective` = particles are much larger than the wavelength

#### **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** {.unnumbered}

-   Radar collects at longer wavelengths than optical sensors - pass through clouds that have smaller particle sizes (wavelength dictates how far it can penetrate into medium)
-   Has it's own bands - e.g. P, L, S, C, X, Ku, K
-   Collects data at night

#### **Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)** {.unnumbered}

-   View (e.g. sensor) and illumination (e.g. sun) angles can change
-   Energy being reflected from the surface that is smooth or diffuse

#### **Polarization** {.unnumbered}

***Definition***

Applicable to Radar: Electromagnetic waves are polarized and the direction depends on the oscillation of the electromagnetic field. When they are reflected from the surface the waves can be linked to surface properties - roughness, shape, orientation, moisture, salinity, density.

***Different ploarizations***

-   Single polarization: same polarization transmitted and received = 1 horizontal (or vertical)
-   Dual polarization: One sent, different one received = transmits and receives both horizontal and vertical
-   Quad polarization: system can transmit and receive four types = emitted in horizontal (H) and received in horizontal (H)

### **1.4 Remote sensing data**

#### **Data formats** {.unnumbered}

-   band interleaved by line (BIL)
-   band sequential (BSQ)
-   band interleaved by pixel (BIP)
-   `GeoTIFF (most common)`

#### **Four resolutions** {.unnumbered}

-   `Spatial` = the size of the raster grid per pixel (e.g. 20cm or 30m)
-   `Spectral` = the number of bands it records data in...more soon
-   `Temporal` = the time it revisits (e.g. daily, every 7 days, on demand)
-   `Radiometric` = identify differences in light or reflectance, in practice this is the range of possible values.

#### **Type of orbit** {.unnumbered}

-   `geosynchronous orbit (GSO)` = satellite matches the Earth's rotation
-   `geostationary orbit` = holds same position, usually only for communications but some sensors are geostationary.
