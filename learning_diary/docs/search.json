Waves are part of the EMR spectrum.\nEnergy carried by EMR waves = radiant energy\nEnergy per unit of time = radiant flux\nEnergy from the sun = incoming short wave radiation or shortwave radiation\nEnergy (solar power) from the sun per unit area per unit time (from electromagnetic radiation) = solar irradiance (per unit time - flux)\nEnergy leaving a surface per unit area per unit time = Exitance (emittance) (per unit time - flux)\nFlux means time here.\n\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic radiation (EMR)\nEMR has both electric and magnetic fields, propagates (moves) as waves: c = vλ\n\nc = velocity of light 3 x 10^8 meters per second\nv = frequency, rate of oscillation\nλ = wavelength, distance between two crests\n\nEMR isn’t automatically reflected. It experiences a number of changes prior to hitting the sensor\n\nSurface: Energy being absorbed by the surface and being transmitted through the surface\nAtmospheric: Energy can be scattered by particles in the atmosphere\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Interacting with Earth’s surface\n\nAtmospheric scattering\n\nRayleigh = particles are very small compared to the wavelength\nMie = particles are the same size compared to the wavelength\nNon selective = particles are much larger than the wavelength\n\n\n\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\n\nRadar collects at longer wavelengths than optical sensors - pass through clouds that have smaller particle sizes (wavelength dictates how far it can penetrate into medium)\nHas it’s own bands - e.g. P, L, S, C, X, Ku, K\nCollects data at night\n\n\n\nBidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)\n\nView (e.g. sensor) and illumination (e.g. sun) angles can change\nEnergy being reflected from the surface that is smooth or diffuse\n\n\n\nPolarization\nDefinition\nApplicable to Radar: Electromagnetic waves are polarized and the direction depends on the oscillation of the electromagnetic field. When they are reflected from the surface the waves can be linked to surface properties - roughness, shape, orientation, moisture, salinity, density.\nDifferent ploarizations\n\nSingle polarization: same polarization transmitted and received = 1 horizontal (or vertical)\nDual polarization: One sent, different one received = transmits and receives both horizontal and vertical\nQuad polarization: system can transmit and receive four types = emitted in horizontal (H) and received in horizontal (H)\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Remote sensing data\n\nData formats\n\nband interleaved by line (BIL)\nband sequential (BSQ)\nband interleaved by pixel (BIP)\nGeoTIFF (most common)\n\n\n\nFour resolutions\n\nSpatial = the size of the raster grid per pixel (e.g. 20cm or 30m)\nSpectral = the number of bands it records data in…more soon\nTemporal = the time it revisits (e.g. daily, every 7 days, on demand)\nRadiometric = identify differences in light or reflectance, in practice this is the range of possible values.\n\n\n\n\nSpectral resolution. Source: NASA Science\n\n\n\n\nType of orbit\n\ngeosynchronous orbit (GSO) = satellite matches the Earth’s rotation\ngeostationary orbit = holds same position, usually only for communications but some sensors are geostationary."
