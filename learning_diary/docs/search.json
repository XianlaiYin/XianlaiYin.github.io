Waves are part of the EMR spectrum.\nEnergy carried by EMR waves = radiant energy\nEnergy per unit of time = radiant flux\nEnergy from the sun = incoming short wave radiation or shortwave radiation\nEnergy (solar power) from the sun per unit area per unit time (from electromagnetic radiation) = solar irradiance (per unit time - flux)\nEnergy leaving a surface per unit area per unit time = Exitance (emittance) (per unit time - flux)\nFlux means time here.\n\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic radiation (EMR)\nEMR has both electric and magnetic fields, propagates (moves) as waves: c = vλ\n\nc = velocity of light 3 x 10^8 meters per second\nv = frequency, rate of oscillation\nλ = wavelength, distance between two crests\n\nEMR isn’t automatically reflected. It experiences a number of changes prior to hitting the sensor\n\nSurface: Energy being absorbed by the surface and being transmitted through the surface\nAtmospheric: Energy can be scattered by particles in the atmosphere\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Interacting with Earth’s surface\n\nAtmospheric scattering\n\nRayleigh = particles are very small compared to the wavelength\nMie = particles are the same size compared to the wavelength\nNon selective = particles are much larger than the wavelength\n\n\n\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\n\nRadar collects at longer wavelengths than optical sensors - pass through clouds that have smaller particle sizes (wavelength dictates how far it can penetrate into medium)\nHas it’s own bands - e.g. P, L, S, C, X, Ku, K\nCollects data at night\n\n\n\nBidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)\n\nView (e.g. sensor) and illumination (e.g. sun) angles can change\nEnergy being reflected from the surface that is smooth or diffuse\n\n\n\nPolarization\nDefinition\nApplicable to Radar: Electromagnetic waves are polarized and the direction depends on the oscillation of the electromagnetic field. When they are reflected from the surface the waves can be linked to surface properties - roughness, shape, orientation, moisture, salinity, density.\nDifferent ploarizations\n\nSingle polarization: same polarization transmitted and received = 1 horizontal (or vertical)\nDual polarization: One sent, different one received = transmits and receives both horizontal and vertical\nQuad polarization: system can transmit and receive four types = emitted in horizontal (H) and received in horizontal (H)\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Remote sensing data\n\nData formats\n\nband interleaved by line (BIL)\nband sequential (BSQ)\nband interleaved by pixel (BIP)\nGeoTIFF (most common)\n\n\n\nFour resolutions\n\nSpatial = the size of the raster grid per pixel (e.g. 20cm or 30m)\nSpectral = the number of bands it records data in…more soon\nTemporal = the time it revisits (e.g. daily, every 7 days, on demand)\nRadiometric = identify differences in light or reflectance, in practice this is the range of possible values.\n\n\n\n\nSpectral resolution. Source: NASA Science\n\n\n\n\nType of orbit\n\ngeosynchronous orbit (GSO) = satellite matches the Earth’s rotation\ngeostationary orbit = holds same position, usually only for communications but some sensors are geostationary."

    "section": "2 Application",
    "text": "2 Application\n\nThis week’s lecture is mainly about the basic knowledge of remote sensing and Electromagnetic radiation (EMR), so I would like to introduce some of the remote sensing applications based on spectral characteristics here.\n\n\n2.1 Remote sensing applications based on spectral features\nRemote sensing uses spectral features to identify, classify and analyse a variety of features on the surface or in the atmosphere. Remote sensing has many applications using spectral features：\n\nIn the field of agriculture, the spectral characteristics of vegetation can be used to monitor the growth of crops, damage, yield prediction, etc.\nIn the field of environmental, the spectral characteristics of water bodies, soil and atmosphere can be used to monitor water quality, soil types, pollutant types and concentrations, etc.\nIn the field of geology, the spectral characteristics of rocks, minerals, etc. can be used to detect mineral resources, geological formations, seismic activity, etc.\nIn the field of urban planning, the spectral characteristics of buildings, roads, etc. can be used to extract urban spatial information, assess the level of urban development and influencing factors, etc.\n\nThe specific application methods of remote sensing based on spectral features in the field of urban planning are mainly as follows:\n\nUsing remote sensing images to obtain information on the current situation of land use, analyse the structure and spatial distribution characteristics of urban land use, and provide basic data for urban planning.\nUsing remote sensing images for urban ecological environment evaluation, monitoring urban heat island effect, air quality, tree health, water quality and other environmental indicators, and providing ecological guarantee for urban planning.\nUse remote sensing imagery for urban construction change monitoring, identifying the impact of urban construction activities on land use, and providing dynamic management for urban planning.\n\n\n\n2.2 Application case\nCharacterizing and classifying urban tree species using bi-monthly terrestrial hyperspectral images in Hong Kong\nSourse: Abbas et al. (2021)\nUrban trees exhibit a wide range of ecosystem services that have long been unveiled and increasingly reported. The ability to map tree species and analyze tree health conditions would become vividly essential. Remote sensing techniques, especially hyperspectral imaging, are being evolved for species identification and vegetation monitoring from spectral reponse patterns.\n\n\n\nAn example of image clustering and corresponding spectral signatures of classes. The shadow class in grey represents canopy shadow and/or branches, and the shadow class in orange indicates shaded leaves.\n\n\nIn this study, a hyperspectral library for urban tree species in Hong Kong was established comprising 75 urban trees belonging to 19 species. 450 bi-monthly images were acquired by a terrestrial hyperspectral camera (SPECIM-IQ) from November 2018 to October 2019. A Deep Neural Network classification model was developed to identify tree species from the hyperspectral imagery with an overall accuracy ranging from 85% to 96% among different seasons. Representative spectral reflectance curves of healthy and unhealthy conditions for each species were extracted and analyzed. This can be used to identify urban trees and monitor their health.\n\n\n\nThe overall workflow of species classification framework using the Deep Neural Network modelling."
