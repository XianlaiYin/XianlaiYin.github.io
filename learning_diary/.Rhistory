This week I learnt the principles and methods of correcting, merging and enhancing remotely sensed images and understood how to pre-process remotely sensed data. Although most of the data we acquired had already been pre-processed, this knowledge gave me a better understanding of how to apply remote sensing images to the actual analysis and what could cause errors and whether further processing was needed. In addition, the study of remote sensing image enhancement has taught me more about remote sensing data analysis methods and principles in a deeper way.
